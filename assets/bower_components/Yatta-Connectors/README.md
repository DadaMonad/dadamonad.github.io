# Connector-Interface
The idea is, to create different implementations of the Connector interface that enable communication within a group. 
It has a minimal interface and covers some frequently occuring problems thay you probably will encounter if you use communitcation protocols directly. 

E.g. You can exchange the PeerJs-Connector with the XMPP-Connector only by changing few lines of code.

It is the communication interface used by [Yatta](https://github.com/DadaMonad/Yatta). 

Currently we have interfaces for:
* PeerJs

More information about the Connector interface will follow. (Trust the update frequency, this could be a lie)
