Create memes collaboratively. Everyone is able to see the changes you make in Real-Time. Open this page in another tab and be amazed. You find the complete source code for this example on [Github](https://github.com/DadaMonad/meme-together.git).

This example works in every recent browser except `IE` (just because it uses polymer elements).
